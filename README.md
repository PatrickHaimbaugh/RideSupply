# RideSupply

## 1. Purpose
Organizations hosting events struggle with organizing and maintaining transportation for participants. I plan on creating an application that will streamline the process of managing and requesting rides. A website will be offered for the hosting organizations, and the guests will use a smart phone app on either Andriod or IOS. Drivers will also use the smart phone app.

RideSupply is also a method of learning new technologies, so that I can become more well rounded of a developer.
